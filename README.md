# The weather forecast

Running app can be accessed [here](http://yqbk.github.io/weather).

## General info

The goal of this project is to change the city of the city. By default, it displays the weather forecast for Warsaw.

- In general, the project uses react with redux and thunk.
- To display the charts I've decided to use Chartist.js.
- To show the current weather. I've used weather-icons icons set.

### Ideas for improvements

- Better test coverage (I've only included some basic tests of redux actions)
- More interactivity for charts
- More configuration options

The project was created using [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
